# Super_Teamalizer
Teamalizer Project for Brett Hammit for Dr. Reeves' SE20 CS374 class at Abilene Christian University. 


Pitch
This product is able to allow teachers the flexability to have student vote for their preferences of who they would like to work with and who they would not like to work with and run them through a sorting algorithm to find what the best partition of teams would be.

The Solution


Glossary
# General terms
-Person: The name of a person that corresponds with their preference of working with another person in the file.
-Team: A team has at least two people and a maximum of half the class size.
-Happiness: Happiness is the level of satisfaction or disatisfaction that a student has with the other students in the class. It is specified in the file that is given to the sorter.
Individual Happiness: The happiness rate of each student in a team.
Team Happiness: The total happiness level of a team.
Class size: Class size is the number of students in a class, before students are divided into teams.

# Important Functions
calc() : function that handles calculating the happiness of team as well as individuals
mix() : function that deals with mixing the teams to find the highest happiness value
get() : pulls names from the array and also determines team size and finds the placeholder positions
getWeight() : function to splice array and get names and weights and store the in seperate arrays with pholders accounted for
showTeams(): function that shows the output of teams

# Test Functions
calctest
goodNames
Mix test
Pholder Test


# Master Story
-get a plan mapped out of what might go into the system
-figure out how to put students into different arrays
-think about everyones preferences
-write test functions


# Inception Deck


# Why are we here?
We're here to try and solve the problem of putting people randomly into teams based off of their preference.


# Pitch
This product is able to allow teachers the flexability to have student vote for their preferences of who they would like to work with and who they would not like to work with and run them through a sorting algorithm to find what the best partition of teams would be.

# Product Box
Any teachers who might want to use something that puts groups together that will allow for more collaboration then uisng the Teamalizer sorter will be for any teacher who is seeking for that.

# The Not List
There will not be any UI for this program and will only run in the terminal.

# Meet Your Neigbors
This was a solo project so there really was no meeting of the neighbors, unless you can count talking to Luis from time to time.

# The Solution
The solution is a Super Teamalizer sorter that allows to feed input with students preferences of who they want to work and will return a list of what the best teams would be based off of happiness.


# What keeps me up at night:
The things of the project that would keep me up is the inner works of the project that you can never really be sure if they are working all good.


# Size it up:
The project has been throughout the semester and is has supposed to been worked on each week slowly chipping away.


# Be clear on what is going to give:
It has to give consistent time and trying to deliver one thing week by week.


# What is it going to take:
It is going to take time commitment and a willness to work throughout the semester.
